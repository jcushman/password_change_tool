# This is disabled for now because PhantomJS 1.9.7 doesn't play well with React,
# so Facebook doesn't enable the Save Changes button after we type.
# Hopefully this script will work when PhantomJS 2 comes out.
# In the meantime we could do something clever like
#  - [executeScript, "//input[@value='Save Changes']", "arguments[0].removeAttribute('disabled')"]
# but that doesn't work as-is and I'm tired of messing with it.
steps:
  # log in
  - [open, "https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=account&section=password&view"]
  - [type, id=email, "{{ username }}"]
  - [type, id=pass, "{{ old_password }}"]
  - [click, name=login]

  # submit form
  - [type, id=password_old, "{{ old_password }}"]
  - [type, id=password_new, "{{ new_password }}"]
  - [type, id=password_confirm, "{{ new_password }}"]
