# Disabling this for now. PhantomJS 2.9 doesn't play well with Facebook's javascript (React),
# or with javascript disabled. Need to figure out some workaround, or wait for the next release.

steps:
  # log in
  - [open, "https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=account&section=password&view"]
  - [type, id=email, "{{ username }}"]
  - [type, id=pass, "{{ old_password }}"]
  - [click, name=login]

  # submit form
  - [type, id=password_old, "{{ old_password }}"]
  - [type, id=password_new, "{{ new_password }}"]
  - [type, id=password_confirm, "{{ new_password }}"]
  - [click, "//input[@value='Save Changes']"]

  - [assertText, //body, "Your Password Has Been Changed"]
